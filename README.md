# Spritulo

About  
-------------------

**Spritulo** ([IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English): /sprɪtˈuː.loʊ/; [Respelled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key) *sprit-OO-loh*) is a block-script handwriting font with massive multilingual support spanning Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic. It started as a project to create a modern handwriting font for Ancient Greek, but has since expanded to include a diverse character set including Vietnamese and Bulgarian Cyrillic. It is based on the handwriting of the designer using a felt-tip pen, with some creative liberties and beautification added in.

The Cyrillic letterforms blend block-script versions with some cursive features.

Name  
-------------------

*Spritulo* is Esperanto for “witticist” or “clever guy”, from *sprit(a)* “witty” and *-ulo* “[person characterized by said feature]”.

Its Esperanto name continues the theme from my previous Google Fonts project, [Orelega One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Orelega+One); *Orelega* is Esperanto for “big-eared”.

Known issues  
-------------------

* (The version of) FontForge (that runs fine on my PC) can only export a broken features.fea file. Loading it on FontForge removes all OpenType features except kerning. Thanks for nothing, FontForge.
  * Therefore, features.fea must be written by hand, and any new glyphs must be manually added to the glyphs folder. Thanks again, FontForge.
